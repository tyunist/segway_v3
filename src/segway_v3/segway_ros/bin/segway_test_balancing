"""
This script is used to force the machine into balance mode. Balance mode is very
dangerous if you do not understand the system dynamics, the operational model and
the potential hazards to avoid when balancing. This can all be learned from the 
manual. 

To enter balance (220 only), run this script (rosrun vector_ros segway_test_balancing).

The machine will start to beep indicating that it is waiting for the balance entry
criteria to be met. The criteria are:

1. Balance mode must be unlocked, it is locked by default
2. The platform must be in standby mode to make the transition to balance mode
3. The PSE must be initialized, which requires the machine be at less that 35deg pitch
4. The pitch angle must cross through 0 deg (machine upright)
5. The pitch rate must be low (ie don't fling the machine back, slowly tilt it back to upright)

Slowly tilt the machine back, the beeping rate will increase as zero pitch is approached. Once zero
pitch has been crossed the machine will enter balance mode. Immediately let go.

READ THE MANUAL ABOUT HAZARDS AND FULLY UNDERSTAND THE OPERATING PRINCIPLES OF BALANCING BEFORE ATTEMPTING!!!!!!!!
